encodeclub hackathon submission

I built beautiful, simple to use Algorand faucets to get more students on the network that function as a DAO. All you need to do is scan a QR code, connect or download a wallet, and you're set! 

Passionate Algo users can contribute to the DAO by sending Algo to the wallet for others to claim, to increase adoption and awareness.
